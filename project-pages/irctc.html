    <h1 class="section-header">BACKGROUND</h1>
    <p class="section-text">Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) handles online booking of train
      tickets, catering and tourism services for the Indian Railways. Around 5,50,000 to 6,00,000 bookings happen
      everyday. IRCTC Rail Connect is an Android app that aims to make the ticket booking process faster and easier.</p>
    <h1 class="section-header">GOAL</h1>
    <p class="section-text">The goal of the project was to evaluate the existing android ticket booking app and provide
      suggestions to enhance user experience for hassle free ticket booking </p>
    <img src="./irctc/2.png" class="center-image" id="three-screens" />
    <h1 class="section-header">RESEARCH</h1>
    <p class="section-text">I interviewed users and tested the usability of the existing app by making them perform a
      ticket booking task. This process helped me gain insights about various user groups and how they interact with
      the app. Here are two sample vidoes of the usability testing:</p>

    <h1 class="section-header">HEURISTIC ANALYSIS</h1>
    <p class="section-text">Following my user research, I conducted a Heuristic analysis of the app. This helped me
      figure out the reasons behind the identified pain points. I assigned a severity rating to each of the identified
      pain points.</p>
    <div id="heuristic">
      <h2>Severity Rating</h2>
      <span></span>
      <br />
      <h3>not so severe</h3>
      <h3 id="very-severe">very severe</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="section-text">I used the following heuristics to evaluate the usability of the app:</p>
    <div class="tags">
      <span class="tag">#user control and freedom</span>
      <span class="tag">#error prevention</span>
      <span class="tag">#flexibility and efficiency of use</span>
      <span class="tag">#aesthetic and minimal design</span>

        <br />
        <h2>NEW BOOKING</h2>
        <p>1. It is difficult to understand where exactly to tap to enter the FROM and TO fields.</p>
        <span class="tag">#recognition rather than recall</span>
        <p>2. All the input fields have been crammed into a tiny space while leaving a lot of space unused at the

        <span id="y-span"></span>
        <br />
        <h2>FEATURE INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>1. The screen provides too much information at one time and this makes it diffuclt for users to understand,
          defying the very purpose of this screen (to educate users about the app) </p>
        <span class="tag">#aesthetic and minimal design</span>
        <p>2. Most users who participated in the usability test tried tapping on the information because It also
          mislead them to think that the information is interactive and they can tap on it.</p>
        <span class="tag">#flexibility and efficiency of use</span>
        <p>3. The main call to action “Got it” gets lost in the busy layout</p>

        <br />
        <h2>TRAIN LIST</h2>
        <p>1. “Departure”, “Arrival” and “Travel Time” filters took a lot of users quite some time to understand.</p>
        <span class="tag">#recognition rather than recall</span>
        <p>2. Users have to go back one step to edit their search critera and view results.</p>

        <span class="tag">#error prevention</span>
        <span class="tag">#user control and freedom</span>
        <p>3.The more option gives information about train route. Many users tapped on the more option and got lost.
          They couldn’t return to the train list screen.</p>

        <br />
        <h2>ADDING PASSENGERS</h2>
        <p>1. App bar on the top is cluttered with visual elements and call to actions which most users can’t
          recognize. The IRCTC and CRIS logos on the top look like buttons. Most users tried to tap on them.</p>
        <span class="tag">#aesthetic and minimal design</span>
        <span class="tag">#recognition rather than recall</span>
        <p>2. None of the users understood the function of the “Preferences” button as it is inappropriately placed
          with the “Add Passenger” and “Add Child” buttons </p>
        <span class="tag">#recognition rather than recall</span>
        <p>3. All the input fields have been crammed into a tiny space while leaving a lot of space unused at the
          bottom</p>
        <span class="tag">#aesthetic and minimal design</span>

        <br />
        <h2>PAYMENT</h2>
        <p>1. Categorization is leading to confusion. Example: PayTM wallet would be better placed in ‘e-Wallets’
          option.</p>
        <span class="tag">#recognition rather than recall</span>
        <p>2. Number of taps required can be optimized by spreading out the options in the same screen.</p>
        <span class="tag">#flexibility and efficiency of use</span>
        <p>3. All payment options have been crammed up into a tiny space while leaving a lot of space unused at the

    <h1 class="section-header">PERSONAS</h1>
    <p class="section-text">After finishing the reasearch and heuristic analysis, I created 2 hypothetical personas.
      These personas reflect people who use trains as their most preferred mode of transport and are aware of the
      different aspects of IRCTC’s ticket booking process.</p>

    <p class="section-text">
      I resolved to using a bottom navigation where all the content of the application is available upfront and
      arranged based on the priority of the functionality.
    </p>
    <p class="section-text">
      <strong>
        Ticket booking being the core functionality of the app, is placed at the center.<br />
        Many users check their ticket’s PNR status and visit previous bookings for cancellation.<br />
        The profile and other options are seldom used

          1. Easy login access with PIN.

          <br />
          3. ‘Book Meal’, ‘Air Ticket’, and ‘IRCTC Tourism’ are lesser used features of the app. They are

          1. Simplified interaction: Demarcates Station input and Journey Date.
          <br />
          2. Input fields for Stations are appropriately highlighted for user input along with the option to swap
          <br />
          3. Journey date selection displayed in a separate section, and the options have same prominence to avoid

          2. Easy to edit Boarding Point and Phone Number
